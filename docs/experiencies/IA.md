## Object Detection/Classes Train

* YOLO to traffic light detection in real-time. <<[OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/622b83a4a04fee230729eb6f)>> <<[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bya4XFQ36cBhrG2WN9J5CyJWrWCP5fve/view)>> <<[GITHUB](https://github.com/deivid-a1/TEES-Object-detection-YOLO)>><br>
The main target was detect real life traffic lights (green, red and yellow) through a training made from a game (GTAV).

## Image Treatment

* Repository with a bunch of exercises about image treatment using OpenCV Framework. <<[GitHub](https://github.com/deivid-a1/studying-image-treatment-opencv)>>
